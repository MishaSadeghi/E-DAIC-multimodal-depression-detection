    # p0 = """ How are you doing today? Okay, how about yourself? I'm great, thanks. Where are you from originally? Here in California. Really? Yeah. What are some things you really like about LA? Oh, well, that it's big and broad. It's a lot to do. A lot of job opportunities than other states. Pretty much that it's big and it's a lot you can do here. Yeah. What are some things you don't really like about LA? Traffic. Maybe the violence rate, the bad news, even though you want to know what's going on in your environment, but you still have to watch it so you can look out to see what's going on on a daily basis. What did you study at school? Sociology. I have a two-year degree in liberal arts, but my major was sociology. Nice. Are you still working in that? No, I'm actually an MTA bus operator. What's your dream job? Well, since Metro is study growing, my dream job is to move up in the company, and I'm about to actually start some classes for supervisory next week. Because they look to promote within the company, so that's a good thing. It's a lot of opportunities at Metro where you can take classes in there, pay for your tuition, and things of that nature. That sounds like a great situation. Thanks. How hard is that? Well, it's not actually hard. Right now it's easy if you take advantage of it right now, because they look to promote within, so since I'm already working there, that's a good thing. So it's good to go ahead and take the classes that you need, that you're interested in, and go ahead and move up the ladder as soon as possible. That makes sense. Do you consider yourself an enabler? What do you mean? I'm sorry. Let's come back to that later. Okay. What do you do to relax? Read, take a long walk, hot bath, meditate, just close my eyes sometimes. Okay. How are you at controlling your temper? I'm pretty much good, because, see, by me being a bus operator, you run into circumstances and situations you've got to remain calm and still remain professional at the same time. Right. How hard is that? Well, I look at it like it comes with experience. You do something on a continuous basis, usually somewhere down the line you become good at it. So I look at it like that. I've been driving for years and dealing with the public, so it's just how you handle circumstances. You treat people like you want to be treated. Has that gotten you in trouble? No, I'm pretty good at it now. Maybe when I was younger. But as you get older, you get wiser and you learn different things, and I'm still learning today. Yeah. Who's some of the positive influence in your life? I would say my family, my kids, even though I've been having a lot of deaths around me, but that's part of the life experience. You're born here, but you've got to leave here one day. But my kids will keep me sane, and I love them, and my family. That sounds like a great situation. Thank you. Do you find it easy to be a parent? No. What's the hardest thing about being a parent? Setting good examples, you know, because you're the first teacher, you know, you want to set a positive, good example for your kids, and I think that's a good thing, and it starts at home. Can you give me an example of that? Well, by you being the first teacher, your kids, you're the one that they see on a daily basis when they wake up. So whatever's being taught in the home, they're looking and learning every day, you know, whether it's at home, school, you know, kids have a tendency to do things what they see, you know what I mean? So you try to keep it positive and teach them good morals and values and how to get along with other people regardless of race and, you know, different things of that nature. Tell me about your kids. I have a 4-1⁄2-year-old son. I have a 7-year-old daughter, and I also have a 23-year-old. Yeah, I'm about to be, well, my daughter's pregnant with the boy. She has three little girls, so I have three grandkids and one on the way, which is the boy this time. Awesome. Yeah, thank you. What's the hardest thing about being a mom? The hardest thing is, well, right now I'm a single parent, so that makes it hard alone itself, you know? And that can be expensive at times, you know, and it depends on the person's situation, you know, whether they have help or a job, you know, things of that nature to help the situation better. But it's hard, you know, but I try to, you know, keep a job, you know, keep food in the house, you know, just maintain and support my kids the best way I can. Yeah, I see what you mean. What's one of your most memorable experiences? With my kids or just period? Whatever comes to your mind. What's memorable for me is that I'm the only one in my family with a degree, so it's kind of like, yeah, it's kind of like even though I'm the baby of ten kids, you know, and I always kept that in the back of my mind, even though everybody, well, pretty much my whole family have decent jobs, but I'm the one with the degree. So I kind of like gave myself a pat on the back, like, you know, I just, that's the only thing I remember in graduating, you know, and my family there to support me. That's so good to hear. Thank you. How did you feel in that moment? Happy that I accomplished something, you know, just even though it may not be much, but it was better than just having a high school diploma. And I had, I was working on my bachelor's degree, but I ended up in a bad car accident. I never went back. I got distracted, and, you know, I was working at the same time, but I was just like more so. I needed income than schooling at that time because I was a young parent, you know, because I had my daughter at 17, so I was like I needed the money to support her. But I never went back, but I feel like it's never too late. So I felt like I'd take some classes now that I'm with Metro to help me move up the ladder. So that's why I'm starting a class next week. That sounds like a great situation. Thank you. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Hmm. Well, the advice I would have gave myself, that I probably wouldn't have been a young mother at a young age, in that I probably wouldn't have stayed in school, you know, not let the accident just distract me and not, I would have remained in school. I probably wouldn't have had kids early, you know. Rather, I probably would have stayed in school and probably have a part-time job or something. I just feel like education is an excellent thing for a person, just having knowledge and learning different things. Keep your mind open to learning new ideas every day. So I think that's a plus, you know, in anybody's shoes, just to better themselves, you know, through education, maybe to promote within your company or whatever the case may be to help better your career. Yeah. Do you have done anything to avoid it? I'm quite sure. You learn from your mistakes, you know, but at the same time, you don't continue to make the same ones. I feel like it's okay to make a mistake, but as long as you do something to change, you know, like myself, even though I'm going to school late, but still, I'm going, you know. I want to better myself career-wise. Yeah. There are always tradeoffs in life, aren't there? Yes. When was the last time you argued with someone, and what was it about? My oldest daughter, we had an argument because just the life she's living right now and the things that she's going through, and I had told her that she just needs to make some changes to better her situation, and we got into an argument because, you know, how your kids sometimes don't want to hear it, you know, hear the stuff that you're saying, even though it's true, or they just, you know, quote, they just don't want to hear it. You know, they may be going through something they don't want to hear, but we got into an argument about it, but that just happened, you know. I just told her my... How close are you to them? I'm sorry? How close are you to them? Very close, very close. I just told her that the situation my daughter's in right now, she just needs to make some changes to better her life. And I've been telling her. She's kind of, like, stubborn in her own way. You know, I was raised to listen to your mom. You know, your mom is not going to tell you nothing wrong, and I've been telling her over the years, you know, different things, and it's kind of like I was talking to a wall because she did the opposite. And now she's regretting it, you know, because she's like, my mom told me this, you know, why am I doing the opposite? So I guess she got to bump her head a couple of times to get it. It's kind of like I didn't tell you, I left it alone, and now it's up to you to make the change. How hard is that? It's very frustrating because it's like I'm talking to a wall and she's not hearing me. And I'm like, it seems like it's taking forever for her to change, but it's left up to the individual when they're ready. You know what I mean? Once a person gets tired of something, they make a change. It may not be when you want it to happen, but the ball is in her court, you know. I only can do so much. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Oh, wow. I have my days. Since I have two little ones, I kind of like train them to go to bed at 8 o'clock because, you know, they got to go to school. And I think it's important to have a good night's rest because it kind of like gets you ready for the next day or, you know, how you going to feel if you rested. What type of person you going to be that day, you know, because everybody has their days, you know, whether they're good or bad, but that's just part of life. And I feel like if you had a good night's rest, hopefully you'll have a good day, you know. Do you feel that way often? Pretty much. You know, I need my rest because I'm out there driving that bus and dealing with all these people and, you know, the job itself is very stressful. I feel like if I'm rested, it'll help me. What are you like when you don't sleep well? What am I like? Irritated, tired, lazy, you know. I feel like I want to lay down, probably go to sleep, get the rest that I need, but... What do you do when you're annoyed? I never thought about that. I just, you know, because like I said, you know, everybody had their moments, they do. I never thought about that. Hmm. Hmm. Okay. Have you ever served in the military? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. Okay. How would your best friend describe you? I don't really have a best friend, but a person that I deal with that I used to work with, she would probably tell you that I'm very outgoing, a go-getter, dependable, responsible. I'm a people person. I get along with others, you know. I'm kind of like... I leave a good mark, whether I know you or not. If you was to, you know, like you and I now, you know, you'd probably say, oh, she seems like a nice young lady or whatever, you know, something like that. Right. That's great. Thank you. When was the last time you felt really happy? Well, I try to stay happy. I'd rather be happy than sad. My kids keep me going, you know what I mean? Especially when I go to pick them up from school or maybe, hey, Mom, you know, that just kind of like make my day. Just them run up to me, you know, and be happy and excited, you know what I mean? Yeah. That's so good to hear. """

When she's done talking to you, you can go ahead and press this button to let me know that it's done. Okay, thank you. Hi, I'm Mel. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. Think of me as a friend. I don't judge. I can. I'm a computer. I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Where are you from originally? Los Angeles, California. Really? Yes. What are some things you really like about LA? Um, the Southern California lifestyle, the beaches, the active lifestyle. Okay. What are some things you don't really like about LA? The traffic, the pretentious people. Yeah. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? Um, my teachers. Tell me more about that. I don't know. Certain teachers, um, got, uh... spiritual teachers that I, um, find a lot of guidance from. Mm-hmm. What are some things you like to do for fun? I like to skateboard. Awesome. And just stay active, stay healthy. Anything that's, um, outdoors and active and healthy. Hiking, biking, rollerblading, skateboarding. Probably love. That's good. Do you travel a lot? No. Why? I'm not really in a position to travel. Why? I'm not really in a position to travel. Financially. I understand. What do you enjoy about traveling? If I could, I'm sure I would enjoy seeing all the different cultures and places and... meeting all the different people and all the interesting structures and, um... and food, so... Yeah. What do you do to relax? I meditate. And I skateboard. Well, I can meditate on my board. Could you say a little more about that? Mmm... I meditate. It helps me relax. Sometimes if I don't really feel like skating hard, I'll just go for a nice sunset skate and meditate. Nice two-hour skate and just relax. That sounds like a great situation. How hard is that? Mmm... It's not that hard. You just gotta get to the skate spots. You know, I usually like skating. There's some good skate spots in LA, streets in LA. The beaches is always good, so... Nice! Just, uh... It's really not that hard at all. Okay. What are some things that make you really mad? Tsk. The situation with my life right now. Um... I can't find a fucking job. It can be tough to find a good job these days. I don't even care about a good job. I just need a job. Anything that pays. Um... It just gets... It just gets hard after a while. Yeah. Can you tell me about that? I mean... I applied from anywhere and everywhere. From entry level to management. To anywhere in between. And, um... I can't find a job. I can't get a job. So... I'm trying. I'm trying. I'm trying. I'm trying. I'm trying. I'm trying. I'm trying. Yeah. I'm sorry. It is what it is. Do you feel down? Yeah, it's pretty depressing. It's hard. It sucks. Yeah. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Um... It isn't. Do you do it way often? Yes, at least that happens often. When was the last time that happened? Uh, last night I couldn't sleep. Why? Um... Um... Just thinking about my situation. Um... A car payment was due yesterday. And I just... I don't know if I have what it takes to continue to do this. You know? I survive day by day. Trying to see if I can eat. At the end of the day. Um... Have you been diagnosed with depression? Yes. How long ago were you diagnosed? Um... About three years ago. Four years ago. A couple years ago. What got you to seek help? My mood was just not right. I was always feeling down and depressed. Lack of energy, always wanting to sleep. Lack of interest. Do you feel like therapy is useful? I've gone to therapy. It has been useful for me in the past. Is it useful for me now? I don't know. I don't have health insurance. Um... I would love to talk to someone. I just feel like I don't have anyone. So I don't depend on anyone. Yeah. I'm sorry. Did you think you had a problem before you found out? Oh yeah. I've always felt depressed in my life. What were your symptoms? Um... Lack of energy, wanting to sleep a lot, lack of interest. My appetite was uncontrollable. Either lack of or I was just being gluttonous and eating the wrong things. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? Yes. Can you give me an example of that? My sister just passed away. I'm sorry to hear that. It's alright. Six months ago. And I became homeless and jobless two weeks ago. And it got to a point where I just missed her and I wanted to be with her. Yeah. I'm sorry. How close are you to your family? Um... Pretty dysfunctional family. You know, I really can't depend on them. That's why I just depend on myself. So... That sounds really hard. If it is what it is, what are you going to do? Yeah. I'd like to give up, but... My parents just buried their daughter six months ago. They don't want to bury their other daughter. So... What advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I'm just, uh... I just haven't had good luck. I was a corporate manager for twenty years. And, uh... And, uh... Who would have known twenty years ago what advice I would have given myself? Because I tried to commit suicide instead of returning back to work. And so now it's just, uh... It's been rough trying to pick up all the pieces and get my life back together. Um... I don't know what advice I would give myself... When I started with my corporate job twenty years ago. Because I didn't know I'd be here twenty years later. You know? Yeah. When was the last time you felt really happy? Really happy? A couple days ago this week. I've been trying to make ends meet. I've got a lot of things sprouting. I've got a lot of things... That are happening for me. But I need, like, two more weeks here and there. Two more weeks here in L.A. So I can connect the dots, but... Financially, I don't have what it takes to stay here for two more weeks. So... I was happy because I was getting callbacks and... Things were starting to look up for me, but it's just... Time again isn't on my side, so... My car is packed and I'm hitting the road. And I'm taking off and I'm leaving L.A., so... Hmm. How would your best friend describe you? Uh, loyal. Emotional. Strong. That's it. Do you consider yourself an introvert? Um... I have been lately. Um, I was an extrovert for... 20 years when I was a corporate manager. And now I am quite an introvert. And I stay to myself. What made you decide to do that? Circumstances in my life I don't feel as confident. I don't feel... As charming. And as social. Okay. What's one of your most memorable experiences? Hmm... I don't know. It's hard to say. Can't really answer that one. Okay. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Thank you. Goodbye. Bye. I'm going to go ahead and shut everything down. And then we just have a quick post-survey for you to fill out. """
    # p2 = """ Okay, so she's going to chat with you. And then when you're done, she'll let you know when the conference is over. You can press this button. Alright. Yes, it's okay. Fine. They're in Hollywood. Seattle. That's kind of a vague question. You need to change the scenery. I like traveling by train. It's one of my favorite things. Because I don't fly. I can't stand airplanes, so I prefer trains. What's the last time you had a plane? Flying on an airplane? Probably December. I don't know. Probably December of 1986 or 87. How much do you get out of the air? Nothing much to tell really. Usually I just go from LA up to Seattle and up to Vancouver. That's probably the main thing I do. Take the train. Awesome. How often do you get out of the air? Not very often. Once every five years or so. Oh, man. Do you do it on a daily basis? Oh, yeah. Sure. Absolutely. What do you do when you're annoyed by it? It depends on what it is that I'm annoyed by. It could be anything. It depends. What do you say to someone? It depends on whether it's something or someone. If it's someone, I don't get physical towards them. It depends on what they've done to piss me off. I'm certainly not above shouting at them for whatever reason. It just depends. How are you at peace with it? In terms of lashing out at other people physically, I don't do that. In order to let off some aggressions, if need be, I'm not above punching a wall or punching something nearby. I'm not trying to—as long as it doesn't physically hurt me. Just to get some steam. Let off some steam. That's normal for me. When was the last time you argued with someone in person? Who's someone that you've been in contact with in the past? At first I didn't even know you were gay. Oh. At first I didn't even know you were gay. What's your dream job? To open up a record shop. Really? What do you do now? What's one thing that's coming your way? What are you doing? Awesome. Tell me more about that. Did you guys have a relationship? How did you meet? Do you have a roommate?

    # p3 = """ What are some things that make you really mad? Um, really mad? Probably not a lot. I get frustrated with, for example, my daughter does not clean up her room, almost ever. So that, that gets me angry, but, um, in terms of like really, um, getting like heatedly angry, I mean, other than like little things that my children do, you know, especially my oldest child, who's 21, you know, he can be confrontational, so. Other than that, nothing really gets me like really angry. I haven't, I have, I haven't felt that. What's the best thing about being a human? Um, contributing to society, helping, uh, helping to raise, um, responsible people, I guess. Um, and of course the love and the affection and the, um, the fun and the excitement that goes with it, and all the stages that go. I mean, like really right now I'm in a stage where my children, uh, are either adults or teenagers. I only have, I have one 11-year-old and the rest are all teenagers and adults. So it's really fun because we're able to, um, talk about current events and all kinds of stuff that's going on in the world, and, you know, have, have, uh, challenging discussions and that sort of thing. So it's, it's a different level than when you're taking care of babies and, you know, changing diapers and that kind of stuff. What's the hardest thing about being a human? The hardest thing is that it's 24-7. Um, you're never not a parent, you know, and so you have to accept that. And that's, I remember when I first, with my first child, um, thinking, you know, when I brought him home from the hospital, this is it. I mean, there's no going back. You cannot, um, change. I mean, I guess you could if you did something horrible, but, I mean, in normal circumstances you can't change, um, that. And it's a permanent thing and, um, it, it, it, uh, in some ways it takes away your freedom, but in other ways it gives you a different sort of freedom. I see. There are always chaos in life, aren't there? Mm-hmm. Always. What are some of the things that have been a positive influence in your life? I'm sorry? I didn't get what you said. What are some of the things that have been a positive influence in your life? Um, some of the things that have been a positive influence in my life, most importantly my church, um, and my faith, uh, but also my husband. He's been a really, um, he's kind of, he's very, like, logical thinking and very, you know, grounded. So, if I get emotional or I get upset about something, he's always, we balance each other out. Likewise, if he gets upset about something, I'm able to balance him out. So, it's been a, that's been a great gift in my life. How are you very comfortable with temper? Um, I don't, I, I don't think I'd be categorized as somebody with a, a temper. Um, occasionally, I, I, occasionally I get angry, but I don't, like, have, like, rarely do I have outbursts. Um, I'm more, more likely to, you know, to say what I feel, not let it build up. So, you know, like, my husband and I don't rarely fight, like, have arguments that are, you know, yelling and screaming or anything like that. It almost never happens. Because, I, I, like I said, I'm more of a type of person that communicates on the spot. So, if I'm thinking something, I usually communicate it right away instead of letting it build up. That's good. When was the last time you argued with somebody you didn't know? Um, usually I'm arguing with my older son because he, um, you know, he thinks he knows everything. He's 21 years old, so he has the know-it-all mentality. And I'm just telling him that he doesn't know it all, and, you know, as life goes on, he'll learn more. And he's very confident and very self, uh, self, uh, what's the word, self-assured. And so he thinks that, you know, everything he does is correct. And he still has a lot of learning to do. That's all. And it's almost a dream job. Mm-hmm. It is, it can be. Mm-hmm. What do you think is the biggest challenge? I think, um, that many of them are, um, spoiled and live in an environment of, um, of instant gratification. Um, which I think is going to be, um, detrimental to the, to the future of this country. But, um, you know, given that with all the technology we have, there's really not any way to go back. So I, I have, um, hope that, um, they will, I mean, I think this country was built on, on, uh, hard work and, and ethics. And, uh, hopefully our, our, the next generation and the, the generations after that can maintain that, um, that standard of living. I don't know if it's possible. Yeah. How are your best friends, Greg? Mm, as loving, nurturing, um, funny, we laugh a lot. And, um, caring, honest. Things that, um, I mean, my best, I have, well, actually my best friend is, it's two people. It's two sisters that I grew up with and, um, we, I, for some years took care of their mother who has Alzheimer's before my parents got sick. So I had a very close, have a very close relationship with them, still do. And so, um, I'm considered the fourth sister. So I would say that those are my best friends and, and, um, we love each other very much. It's a good relationship. Um, have you ever served in the military? No. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Yes. How long ago was that? Mostly, minorly depression, it was more anxiety. Um, probably, um, it's probably been five or six years. I mean, I've had it off and on all my life, but it was never diagnosed originally. Like as a teenager, I think is when I first had started with the anxiety. But, um, other than that, I, I, you know, so depression kind of goes with anxiety if it's not under control. Um, but now it's under control. So I have a great. Are you triggered by something? Huh? Are you triggered by something? Um, no, I think it was what they call free, free floating anxiety, more of a, of a, of a organic, um, reason for it. In other words, that there was a chemical imbalance in my brain. How have you been feeling lately? I've been feeling pretty good, actually. The holidays were great. We had a good family gatherings, a little stressed because, um, we're making a big decision right now to help my parents out. My dad is really sick and we've offered to move in with them. They have a big home, but we would have to do a lot of, um, some renovation and some to help and some obviously moving around. And so we're in the throes of that. And, um, so that's a big, big change, but I'm looking forward to it because I really don't want my parents to be alone as they get, they're in their 80s. So as they get closer to death, I want to have my family there with them. I understand. How easy is it to be with your kids in sleep? Um, not easy. Usually, all my life I think I've always, I mean, I've always had, um, at least I wake up at least once in the middle of the night. Um, to go to the bathroom, basically. And, um, other than that, I mean, no, now I sleep well. I mean, other than that I sleep well, but sometimes if I wake up like really early in the morning, then I can't go back to sleep. I'll get up and maybe do some work on the computer and then go back to bed and go back to sleep. It depends on what my schedule is and if the kids have to be at school early and there's a lot of factors. That sucks. Yeah, sometimes it does. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Um, probably basically the same. I think I might complain a bit like, oh, I'm tired or my body hurts or whatever, you know. But, um, I think overall I'm probably the same. My kids know. I'll tell my kids, oh, I'm really tired and they'll understand. Like, my older daughter will be really helpful and maybe my other daughter will try to cook dinner or something like that. So, you know, they may pitch in a little bit more. Have you ever stayed in a museum to do your own painting? Um, not really. Not, not, no. Not really. Not anything significant. Huh? Do you feel like therapy is useful? Um, actually, yes, I do. I do feel like therapy is useful. Tell me more about that. Um, well, uh, we had a situation with my daughter. Um, she also suffers from anxiety and, um, we have had her in therapy for some time and we just recently are, we're about to finish a group with her. It was a six month, um, uh, group for DBT it's called. And it's like a, it's the first time they're documenting using it with teenagers. And, um, it's been really good. It's been very helpful. It's just all about how to live in the moment and how to, you know, actual physical and mental, um, strategies to keep your, uh, keep you from, your mind from going crazy, you know, worrying about things or, you know, in this case, some of the kids have tried to harm themselves or whatever. So, um, that's the focus of the therapy and it's been really good. My husband and I both have been going with our daughter and it's been really, um, really informational and really helpful, I think. That's so good to hear. What got you to see the call? Oh, my daughter was, um, she was in a bad way. She was, you know, suffering a lot and we knew it and, um, we acted on it. That's all. That's great. When was the last time you felt really happy? Um, and it was, it happened that our anniversary was, we left on our anniversary day. We flew to Israel. So, it was right at the same time. It was beautiful. Very meaningful. What are some things that you do that have been meaningful? Um, that's an interesting question. I would say, um, once I get, like, things done that I need to do, like, if I have a lot of either work to do around the house or errands to run, once I get them done, I feel like a sense of accomplishment. You know, much like, I mean, I worked for many years as an administrative manager at UCLA and, um, you know, once you get a project done or you get your, whatever, month end stuff done or there's a lot of different things that, you have to make deadlines, there's that feeling of, like, yeah, I got it done, you know. So, I think that would be, you know, for me the most, um, most recent, um, way of feeling good and feeling, you know, like, feeling accomplished. What's your dream job? Dream job? Hmm. I think I've already lived it. I'm also a birth doula and, um, yeah, and, um, so I've attended a lot of births and now I really only do it for family and friends and, um, it's the most rewarding thing you could possibly ask to be involved in is the birth, the bringing of new life into this world. So, I would say that's probably was my, was a dream job and I didn't know it. I trained much after, you know, I did my managerial stuff and, um, it was, it is and was awesome. So, I don't work at a hospital anymore. Actually, the hospital that I worked at is now closed but, um, like I said, I do it for family and friends. What made you decide to do it? Um, I attended a friend of mine's birth by accident. She, she happened to have the same OB as I did with all my children and, um, I came to bring food for her husband when she was in labor. We were, you know, close friends and, you know, her labor picked up quite a bit when I got there. She wanted me to stay. She didn't want me to leave. I hadn't planned on it so that was the first birth that I attended outside of, you know, my self-giving birth which is a whole different experience. So, after that I was really interesting and interested in possibly studying nurse midwifery. But then I discovered this thing called being a doula which is, really gives you even a lot more hands-on, one-on-one contact with the patient which is what I like. So I trained to do that at a hospital in Inglewood about 15 years ago because my son is 15 and he was a year old, no 16 years ago. So, um, yeah. And I've been... How hard is being a doula? Um, well it can be challenging in terms of hours. It depends on how long the woman's in labor but, and, you know, also like for me I always tell my friends and family if they want me to be their doula that I cannot guarantee 100%. I'm not doing it for business and that way, and because of that I don't have like backup doulas that in case I'm sick or I'm not available somebody else could fill in for me. So, um, but so far it's been that all the women that have asked me I've been able to be there for some reason. So the, um, the only one that I missed was one, a friend of mine from church who wanted me to go with her second baby. I was with her for her first but her labor went so fast she didn't even call me. It was in the middle of the night and she was like two hours of labor. She would, even if she had called me I would have been there in time. So, um, it went really fast. But other than that, you know, um, yeah I've been able to attend all the births of people that have asked me to do. What's been your most memorable experience? Um, in all of life or in your job? Uh, probably my, my own birth. I mean my, the birth of my own children. How do you feel about your own birth? Um, like there's an extreme sense of joy, excitement, relief because of course you're out of the pain. And then like it's just, it's just a matter of, you know, going forward from there. But it's, it's like something you can't explain. It's, it's just, it's awesome after you give birth. So, and I've experienced both ways. I've done both natural and I, my last child was by a C-section. So I've had both, both experiences. Is there anything you regret? Um, I, with my third child I had kind of a crazy nurse. She was a little psychotic but other than that, we laugh about it now but when I was in labor it wasn't funny. And um, she, she was not there when the doctor, I mean it was, my, my third child was born very quickly after he broke the water. And woof, my husband was there but she was not nor was the doctor and she got in a lot of trouble. Because I only had like two contractions after that and my daughter was born in the bed. So for me it was great because I didn't have to go through any other labor but um, I'm sure they weren't happy. They have to fill out a lot of paperwork after that. So. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Now would I give myself for 10 or 20 years ago? Um. 10 or 20 years ago I was probably more, not as um, relaxed. Not as um, like I feel now at my age that um, I, I don't have the same concerns that I did then. I don't worry about, I don't worry at all about what people think about me. I don't worry at all about what, you know, you know, like my, I don't even, I don't even worry about it. You know, like my, I notice my daughters, oh mom you can't wear that because people are going to say this, I say I don't care. You know, but they do because it's still in their frame of mind that oh mom you have to dress like this or dress like that or whatever. So that would probably be it. The wisdom that you, you achieve with age that you, you see how life, there's so many things that are more important in life than worrying about little things. What are you most proud of in your life? Most proud of? Um, probably my family. My, my husband and my, my children. I mean the fact that we've stayed married, that we've, we're an intact family, that um, my kids see every day how their friends suffer who, who come from divorced families or single parents. And they, um, they actually express gratitude sometimes that we are married and we still, you know, we are still a family. So I would say that's probably it. That's great """
    # p4 = """ So let's move around just a little bit because we have an Xbox Kinect that's not using motion. There we go. Picking you up just fine. Now I'm going to do something that syncs our equipment. Oh. Syncs your equipment? Yeah. What does that mean? Basically it means the audio and the video can get together. Oh, so they'll be in harmony. In harmony. Okay, alright, sounds good. So I'm going to pull up the virtual human. She's going to chat with you and then when she's done, she'll let you know and you can go ahead and ring that doorbell and let you know that you've been connected. Oh, okay. Alright, please. Hi, I'm Ali. Thanks for coming to my video. I just figured we'd talk about the game today since it's really important. I'm not a character, but I'm really learning about people and it's a lot to learn about you. I'll ask you a few questions to get started. And if you feel free to ask me questions, you can choose to ask me anything you want. Are you in a TV show? Sure. Okay, good. So, how are you doing today? Okay. What's your name? Where are you from originally? Los Angeles. Really? What's the things you really like about LA? Um, well, that's a good question. Um, I like the familiarity with everything. I know where everything is in the city. Mm-hmm. That's all I can say right now. Okay. What are some things you don't really like about LA? So spread out. So hard to get places. What's your dream job? Is there anything else? What's your dream job? My dream job? I don't think there is a dream job. Um, for me, no. There isn't one. What do you do now? I'm sort of unemployed right now. So am I. That's true. What did you study in school? I studied urban planning. What about in school? What are some things you really like about LA? Well, um, I think this school shooting thing and the NRA seeming to not want to budge on this gun control issue thing. That's it. Um, I try to remove myself from that situation. It's annoying me. How have you been controlling your emotions? I've gotten better over the years. Um, most of the time I just try to, um, you know, walk away or, you know, control my emotions in terms of, you know, just walking away. That's good. What do you do for fun? Hmm, just watch TV now. What's one thing that's been really fun for you? Hmm, I would say my children being born. Tell me more about that. Well, I have four children. Um, each birth was special. And, um, you know, it was a unique experience each time. That's great. Do you find it easy with your kids? Well, it's a lot easier now because they're all adults. Um, but, you know, it was challenging. What's the best thing about raising kids? Um, I would say seeing your children grow up to be successful and exceeding your expectations. What's the hardest thing about raising kids? Well, you worry all the time. You worry for them. You know, now I'm not around them as much and I certainly worry about them. How many times? When was the last time you hung out with them? That I saw my children? Oh, about a week ago. How do you feel right now? I'm usually pretty happy when I see them. They're all interesting. When was the last time you hugged somebody you didn't know? My girlfriend and insignificant. Okay. Are you proud of them? No. Around LA maybe, but that's about it. Excuse me. Why? Why don't I travel? I don't have the funds to do that anymore. Or the health. Okay. Have you ever surfed the internet? No. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Yes. How long ago were you diagnosed? Let's say about a year. What taught you to be yourself? Recognizing that there were some things in me that were wrong. Is there something you haven't told yourself yet? I knew that there was something wrong if I wasn't myself. What were you thinking? Well, you know, I was always tired and not excited about things anymore. Kind of lethargic, you know, laying around and just not feeling myself. How often do you do this? About the same. I'm sorry. Do you still go to therapy now? Yes, I do. Once a month. Do you feel like there's a need for it? Yeah, I do. I do. Can you tell me about that? Well, you know, I see a psychologist and we talk about things. I don't really want to elaborate in detail, but I seem to think that it's helpful. What are some of the things that you don't like about yourself? What are some of the things that you don't like about yourself? That things are hard. When was the last time you felt really hard about yourself? Can you say when you felt like that? What's been a lot going on in my life? I just lost my parent, my dad, my last parent. Just a lot of stuff going on. I'll leave it at that. What is something that you do that you don't like? Well, I still like sports. I still like sports. Watching a good game or something usually puts me in a good mood. Particularly if my team wins. I like USC. I have a nephew that's a freshman football player at USC. And I've been a Trojan football fan for 40 years. What would you say is something that you don't like about yourself? I think I listen well. I'm pretty much honest and straightforward. How would your best friend be? Who's someone that's been a problem in your life? I think my best friend has definitely had a positive influence on my entire life. Do you have any regrets? No, I have many regrets. Too many to name a number. But you have the benefit of hindsight. I have a lot of regrets. What advice would you give yourself to help you become a better person? What are you most proud of in your life? My kids. I'm very proud of them. Okay, I think I've asked everything you wanted to know. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Sure, my pleasure. Bye. Okay. """
    # p5 = """ All right, looks good. I'm going to do something that's thanks to AutoCommon. And I'm going to start up the virtual human. She's going to chat with you for a bit. And then when she's done, she'll let you know. And then I'm going to give you the doorbell, and you can walk in when you're all done. OK. Hi. I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people and speak into their environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people. And I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to comment. Your answers are fully confidential. Are you OK with this? Yes. OK. So how are you doing today? I'm fine. This is a little bit strange. Talking to a virtual human. Where are you from originally? I was born in LA. I was raised out in the suburbs. I've lived all over Los Angeles. Lived in the Valley, Long Beach, and now I'm in Culver City. Awesome. What are some things you really like about LA? There's great food here. The weather is great most of the time. There's a lot of sunshine. It doesn't get cold. I don't have to shovel snow. There are lots of opportunities, a lot of diversity, all different sorts of people. I think that's really great. OK. What are some things you don't really like about LA? That is a much longer list I would like to get out of here. The traffic, I think that's number one. I think everybody hates the traffic. And everybody's so busy all the time, it's really hard to get together with anybody. Everybody's so devoted to their jobs. And then we're sitting in traffic a lot too. Yeah. What did you study at school? I just graduated actually. I studied marine biology. Wow. That sounds interesting. How did you decide to do that? I went to school and I originally studied graphic design. And I found that kind of unfulfilling. So I took a trip for a while, traveled around the world, and started scuba diving. And I realized that I really love marine biology. So that's how I got into it. Nice. What's your dream job? Everybody's been asking me that a lot lately since I just graduated. I think I would like to, I think maybe managing a research. I'm not really sure. I think I would like to, something in tropical marine ecology, maybe managing a preserve, something like that. It's a hard question to answer. Do you travel a lot? I do. What do you enjoy about traveling? I like meeting new people and seeing different parts of the world. I'd love to hear about one of your trips. Well, I traveled for eight months in Central America. And I visited a lot of different countries. I went scuba diving. I think intolerance, injustice in the world, those are probably the things that get me the most fired up. Brant to my boyfriend, does that count? How are you at controlling your temper? I'm pretty good. It takes a lot to really get me fired up to the point where I kind of blow my top. Very few people have seen me angry to the point where I'm kind of yelling and screaming angry. I don't know. I just don't get there. I think that I'm a little bit afraid of losing my temper, so I keep it under control. That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone and they helped you with a battle? It was yesterday, actually. I argued with my boyfriend about getting a job. I was talking about taking a job somewhere, and he was being very supportive. And I really wanted him to say, no, don't go take that job for six months, because I would miss you. And he was just being supportive. So we kind of argued about that. It was ridiculous. So I ended up laughing, and that was the end of the fight. That's good. What do you do to relax? Meditate, exercise, go out in nature, just unplug, get myself away from a computer, away from technology, away from people. OK. How close are you to your family? I would say not really. I'm an only child, and it's just me and my parents. And we're very, very dissimilar. For example, I'm a pretty adventurous person, and I like learning. And my parents are couch potatoes. They like to watch reality television. So we don't have too much to talk about or things that we can really do as far as shared activities. So I love them and everything, but there's not too much common ground. I see that you consider yourself an introvert. Yes. I think I'm a very social introvert, but I seem to find most social encounters to be draining. Whereas my boyfriend, for example, he derives a lot of pleasure and energy from being around people. For me, it's always a little bit the opposite. I have to recharge. How are your best friends going to be? Not sure I have a best friend, but I guess I'll say my boyfriend. He's kind of my default best friend. He would probably say passionate, intelligent. He always tells me that I'm really hard on myself, which is true. Dedicated, loyal. That's great. What are you most proud of in your life? I think I'm just proud of who I am. I don't know if that's the answer that most people give, but I think that I'm really proud of who I am. I try really hard. I've done a lot of things in my life. I'm a really good person. I think it's kind of rare to find people that are kind, and I consider myself a kind person that cares about others and wants to make the world a better place. So I'm proud of that. That's so good to hear. Have you ever served in the military? No, I have not. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Yes. How long ago were you diagnosed? I was probably about 15 at the time, so I think eight, what is that, 17 years ago. You're very young, aren't you? Yes. What got you to seek help? I was cutting, and one of my best friends called my parents and let them know. And at that point, they took me in for treatment. That wasn't the first time I had ever been to a therapist or a psychiatrist, but before, it was more they thought I had ADHD. So I think my parents really took me in, rather than me seeking help. Do you still go to therapy now? I haven't for about three years. I stopped because it felt like I was checking in with a parole officer. I just wasn't enjoying the relationship I had, but I still have a psychiatrist that I go to for med checks. That sucks. Do you feel like there's a hospital? I do think it's useful if you have the right therapist. I think if you don't have a good relationship with your therapist, it can be incredibly harmful. I have talked to people that have had bad experiences and won't ever go back. Lately, I've been a little bit down. I should say a little bit more down than usual, because I graduated, and my routine of go to school and do school things 24-7 has come to an end. And without the routine, it's been a little bit weird finding a way to be productive and knowing what to do with my time. It's also been a little bit depressing finding out that my intelligence and good grades in school doesn't translate to real world skills, and there aren't that many jobs for marine biologists in California. Yeah. That sounds really hard. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Almost impossible. Ever since I was a little kid, I had trouble falling asleep. And about four years ago, it became really, really bad, where I just couldn't sleep through the night. I was getting about four hours of sleep. Sometimes I would wake up every hour, and I would wake up in the morning just a complete wreck. So for about four years, I've been taking trazodone so I can sleep. OK. What are you like when you go to sleep? Have you ever seen Fight Club? You're a virtual human, so you probably haven't seen that. But it's pretty much like that. I'm just a complete panicked, anxious wreck. I lose my ability to deal with things. I'm much more likely to lose my temper. I can't regulate my moods. I'm just really volatile. I see. When was the last time that happened? Probably a few months ago. I think that I may have been on a trip, gone away for a weekend, and forgotten to take my medicine with me, or something like that. And then I can't sleep. And so that's what happens. OK. When was the last time you felt really happy? Really happy? Really happy? I mean, I don't know. It's easier for me to keep track of when I feel really, really bad. Really happy? I guess I felt really happy on New Year's Eve, which was 10 days ago. I was with my boyfriend and some friends, and we took a trip out to Palm Springs and Joshua Tree. And it was really nice to see them. I don't get to see them very often because I've been in school and I've been so busy. So it was a really nice reintroduction to real life. That's great. What would you say are some of your best qualities? I think that I'm kind, I'm considerate, I'm tolerant, I'm pretty open-minded, I'm aware of my faults. I just try to be nice to everybody. And I'm very curious about the world and things that I don't know about. I really like to learn. What's one of your most memorable experiences? Off the top of my head, first thing that comes to mind is diving the Blue Hole in Belize. It was really amazing. It was me and my friends. We just jumped off the boat, and you come up over the edge of this limestone sinkhole. And it's really, really, really blue. And we just hopped down to about 140 feet in something like two minutes. We did it pretty quick. Not everybody can do it that quick. And as you go down, you see all these stalagmites and stalactites, and they're huge. They're larger than a human because it's this cave system. And it's really murky, and there's sharks swimming all around you. So that was pretty good. What are some things you like to do for fun? I'm trying to remember that at the moment. I haven't had much free time the last 3 and 1 half years being in school. So I guess reading, hiking, just being together with my friends, doing relatively low-key things, going to movies, having dinner parties, cooking, playing with my cat. Is there anything you regret? Not that I can really think of. I'm sure I've made mistakes in my life, but I'm still here, so it can't be that bad. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? I don't know. Hang in there. Hold on to your clothes because the 90s are coming back in fashion. Cloudy weather, beautiful sunsets, being out in nature, kind of being away from the hubbub of the city, getting a good grade. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? I think my boyfriend has. Especially the last year, he's really inspired me. He quit drinking. He quit smoking. He's made a lot of positive changes in his life. And I know that those things aren't easy. So to see someone overcome that really inspired me. That's great. OK. I think I've lost everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts. OK. Bye. Bye.
